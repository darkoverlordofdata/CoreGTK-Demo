# CoreGTK Demo

Gnustep is great! Up to a point. The gnustep ux is different. It doen't fit my aesthetic.

As an alternative, there is CoreGTK, a GTK wrapper adapter for Objective-C that corrects all of this. It replaces AppKit. You'll also write some different code. But you still have Foundation, so your business logic should stay the same.
